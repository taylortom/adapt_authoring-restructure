# root

Everything contained directly in this folder should be relevant to the entire application. Anything specific to the front-end/back-end should now be found in their respective folders.

Files remaining in this folder are:
- various config files (.editorconfig, .travis.yml etc.)
- install.js
- upgrade.js
- server.js
- package.json
- README.md
- LICENSE
- ... you get the idea

**Note:** I'd like to look into moving the install/upgrade/server commands to the task-runner we choose.
